# UK Trading Tribe Tech Test

Welcome to the UK Trading Tribe Tech Test!

We hope that you find this exercise fun. There are no trick questions; we want to see your solution to a simple problem with well thought-out and well structured code.

## The Brief

Create an application to model a very basic family tree (feel free to use a framework if you wish). The application must fulfil the following core requirements:

* Initialise the family tree with 2 members, 1 male, 1 female.
* Add a child, each child must have 1 father and 1 mother. Parents must be a current family member.
* List both parents for any given family member.
* List children for any given family member
* List all descendants for any given family member
* List all ancestors for any given family member
* These operations should be exposed through a REST API

Please keep it simple. If you require any additional information, please ask. We would rather you asked obvious questions and got it right rather than not ask questions and get it wrong. (Asking good questions is seen as a positive!)

## Review Criteria

All tech test submissions (for any of our tech tests) are anonymised and reviewed using a standard template.

At a high level we will be looking for:
* Clear instructions for how to run the application on a reviewer's machine
* Good understanding of the programming language and its features
* Well structured, readable code
* High quality code that uses relevant design patterns
* Appropriate automated tests
* Security best practices applied
* Good understanding of logging and errors and how to handle them

## Languages

We use a mixture of coding languages but for data consumption we mainly use Java (Kotlin) and Node. For this tech test we recommend you use Java, but if you don't know either or you can show off your skills better in another language then please do so.

## Timescale

Please time-box this exercise at about 3 hours. If you've spent more than that and you're still not finished, just submit what you have - we're more interested in what you have done, not what you haven't, nor do we want this to take up a huge amount of your time.

## The Deliverable

Replace the contents of this README.md with:

  1. A covering note explaining the technology choices you have made.
  1. Any instructions required to run your solution and tests in a Linux environment.

Email as an attachment or a link the git bundled repository showing your commit history with all your commits on the master branch:

        git bundle create <anything>.bundle --all

## Equality & Diversity

We consider all candidates equally, fairly and without bias.  To that end, we ask that you do not leave any personally identifying information in your submission (such as your name within an author field or file, or in use as test data).  We run all VCS-based submissions through an anonymiser before assessment, so that there is no identifying information in the commit history, but this will only remove references in the committing author and email address, not deep in the code submitted.
